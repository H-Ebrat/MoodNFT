# Contributing to MoodNft

We love your input! We want to make contributing to this project as easy and transparent as possible, whether it's:

- Reporting a bug
- Discussing the current state of the code
- Submitting a fix
- Proposing new features
- Becoming a maintainer

## Development Process

We use GitHub to host code, to track issues and feature requests, as well as accept pull requests.

### Pull Requests

Pull requests are the best way to propose changes to the codebase. We actively welcome your pull requests:

1. Fork the repo and create your branch from `main`.
2. If you've added code that should be tested, add tests.
3. If you've changed APIs, update the documentation.
4. Ensure the test suite passes.
5. Make sure your code lints.
6. Issue that pull request!

### Development Setup

1. Fork and clone the repository
2. Install dependencies: `make install`
3. Build the project: `make build`
4. Run tests: `make test`

### Code Style

- Follow the [Solidity Style Guide](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/latest/style-guide.html)
- Use meaningful variable and function names
- Add comments for complex logic
- Keep functions small and focused

### Testing

- Write unit tests for new features
- Ensure all tests pass before submitting PR
- Add integration tests for complex interactions
- Test edge cases and error conditions

### Commit Messages

We use conventional commits. Your commit messages should follow this format:

```
type(scope): description

[optional body]

[optional footer]
```

Examples:
- `feat(contracts): add mood flipping functionality`
- `fix(tests): correct access control test`
- `docs(readme): update installation instructions`

Types:
- `feat`: A new feature
- `fix`: A bug fix
- `docs`: Documentation only changes
- `style`: Changes that do not affect the meaning of the code
- `refactor`: Code changes that neither fix bugs nor add features
- `test`: Adding missing tests or correcting existing tests
- `chore`: Changes to the build process or auxiliary tools

## Any contributions you make will be under the MIT Software License

In short, when you submit code changes, your submissions are understood to be under the same [MIT License](http://choosealicense.com/licenses/mit/) that covers the project. Feel free to contact the maintainers if that's a concern.

## Report bugs using GitHub's [issue tracker](https://github.com/yourusername/foundry-ntfs/issues)

We use GitHub issues to track public bugs. Report a bug by [opening a new issue](https://github.com/yourusername/foundry-ntfs/issues/new).

**Great Bug Reports** tend to have:

- A quick summary and/or background
- Steps to reproduce
  - Be specific!
  - Give sample code if you can
- What you expected would happen
- What actually happens
- Notes (possibly including why you think this might be happening, or stuff you tried that didn't work)

## Feature Requests

We welcome feature requests! Please:

1. Check existing issues first
2. Provide a clear use case
3. Explain the value it would add
4. Consider implementation complexity
